## High-Level Design (HLD):
The system consists of a multi-agent architecture where each agent performs a specific task. These agents interact with each other to produce actionable insights, use cases, and resources that enhance operational efficiency and customer experiences using AI/GenAI.

Key Components:

User Interface (UI): Built with Streamlit to allow users to input company information and trigger the workflow.
Industry Research Agent: Gathers industry insights using search tools (e.g., Tavily, Serper).
Use Case Generation Agent: Proposes AI/GenAI use cases based on the industry insights.
Resource Collection Agent: Collects datasets and tools needed to implement the proposed use cases.
Proposal Compilation Agent: Compiles a final proposal that includes the use cases, resources, and insights.
High-Level Architecture Flow:
User Input: The user provides the company's name via the Streamlit UI.
Industry Research Agent: The agent uses web scraping/search APIs to gather industry-specific data (trends, key focus areas).
Use Case Generation Agent: Based on the research, this agent generates AI/ML use cases for the company.
Resource Collection Agent: This agent fetches relevant datasets and tools (e.g., from Kaggle, HuggingFace).
Proposal Compilation Agent: Compiles all data into a cohesive proposal, which is then displayed on the UI.
Final Output: The UI presents the generated use cases, resources, and a proposal to the user.
Flowchart (HLD):

User Input (Streamlit) → Industry Research Agent → Use Case Generation Agent → Resource Collection Agent → Proposal Compilation Agent → UI Output (Report).

## Low-Level Design (LLD)
The Low-Level Design focuses on the individual components, their internal workings, data flow, and detailed interaction between agents.

Components of the System:

User Interface (UI):
Framework: Streamlit.
Role: Facilitates interaction with the user (input company name, view generated report).
Functionality:
Input company name.
Trigger agents.
Display output (research insights, use cases, resources).

Industry Research Agent:
Role: Conducts market research to understand the company’s industry, offerings, trends, and focus areas.
Data Flow:
Input: Company name.
Output: Industry insights, trends, strategic focus.

Use Case Generation Agent:
Role: Proposes AI/GenAI use cases based on industry insights.
Data Flow:
Input: Industry insights from the Research Agent.
Output: AI/GenAI use cases.

Resource Collection Agent:
Role: Finds datasets and tools necessary for implementing the proposed use cases.
Data Flow:
Input: Proposed use cases.
Output: Datasets and tools (links to Kaggle, HuggingFace, GitHub).

Proposal Compilation Agent:
Role: Compiles a final proposal that includes the industry insights, use cases, and resource links.
Data Flow:
Input: Industry insights, use cases, resources.
Output: A formatted proposal (text or markdown).

Data Flow and Interaction:
User Interface:
User inputs the company name.
The UI triggers the Industry Research Agent.

Industry Research:
Research Agent fetches industry-related insights (company’s sector, trends).
It passes these insights to the Use Case Generation Agent.

Use Case Generation:
Use Case Generation Agent creates relevant use cases based on the insights and passes them to the Resource Collection Agent.
Resource Collection:

The Resource Collection Agent fetches relevant resources and tools and hands them to the Proposal Compilation Agent.
Proposal Compilation:

The Proposal Compilation Agent combines insights, use cases, and resources into a cohesive proposal.
The Streamlit UI displays the results.


Architecture Diagram (Flowchart):
You can visualize this system with the following flow:
User Input (Company Name)
       |
       v
Industry Research Agent ---> Use Case Generation Agent ---> Resource Collection Agent ---> Proposal Compilation Agent
       |                              |                               |                              |
       v                              v                               v                              v
   Industry Insights ---> Generated Use Cases ---> Datasets and Tools ---> Final Proposal for User



## Conclusion
This design ensures that the system is modular and each agent is responsible for a specific task, ensuring maintainability and scalability. Let me know if you need further details, such as specific technologies or frameworks to use!
